# Development Roadmap

This document outlines the planned development phases for MyGamesAnywhere.

## Guiding Principles

1. **Start simple, iterate quickly** - MVP first, features later
2. **End-to-end functionality** - Complete flows over partial features
3. **User feedback driven** - Build what users actually need
4. **Open source friendly** - Easy for contributors to join

---

## Phase 0: Foundation (Complete ‚úÖ)

**Goal:** Complete design and prepare for implementation.

**Tasks:**
- [x] Define project goals and scope
- [x] Design architecture (client-server model)
- [x] Choose technology stack (Ionic + Capacitor + Go)
- [x] Design database schema
- [x] Design plugin system (client-side TypeScript modules)
- [x] Document everything
- [x] Decide phase ordering (integrations first!)

**Deliverables:**
- ‚úÖ Complete documentation (ARCHITECTURE.md, DESIGN_DECISIONS.md, PLUGINS.md, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Development setup guide
- ‚úÖ Detailed Phase 1 plan (integration libraries)

---

## Phase 1: Core Integrations (Current üöÄ)

**Goal:** Build and test core integration libraries as standalone TypeScript packages. Prove hardest integrations work BEFORE building UI or server.

**Duration:** 5-6 weeks

**Detailed Plan:** See [PHASE1_DETAILED.md](./PHASE1_DETAILED.md) for complete specification.

### Why This First?

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Integrations are the hardest and most unknown part
- Building UI first risks discovering integrations don't work
- Standalone packages are easier to test and debug
- Can reuse these packages later in plugin system

**Validate:**
- Steam VDF parsing actually works
- Google Drive OAuth flow actually works
- IGDB API integration actually works
- Game launching actually works

### Deliverables

**Five Standalone TypeScript Packages:**

1. **@mygamesanywhere/steam-scanner** ‚úÖ
   - Detect Steam installation
   - Parse libraryfolders.vdf and .acf files
   - Extract installed game information
   - Steam Web API integration (username-based auth)
   - Steam Client integration (install/uninstall/launch)
   - 88 unit tests with real Steam data

2. **@mygamesanywhere/gdrive-client** ‚úÖ
   - OAuth 2.0 authentication flow
   - List files in folders
   - Download files with progress
   - 41 unit tests with mocked APIs

3. **@mygamesanywhere/igdb-client** (placeholder)
   - Twitch OAuth (required for IGDB)
   - Search games by title
   - Fetch detailed metadata
   - Rate limiting (4 req/sec)
   - Unit tests with mocked APIs

4. **@mygamesanywhere/generic-repository** ‚úÖ (Phase 1 complete)
   - Scan local/cloud directories for games
   - Detect installers (.exe, .msi, .pkg, .deb, .rpm)
   - Detect portable games (game directories with executables)
   - Detect ROMs (NES, SNES, GB, PlayStation, etc.)
   - Detect archives (single & multi-part: .zip, .rar, .7z, .part1, .z01, etc.)
   - Detect emulator-required games (DOSBox, ScummVM)
   - Cross-platform support (Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, iOS)
   - Repository adapters (Local filesystem, cloud storage ready)
   - Smart executable detection (main game .exe vs config/uninstaller)
   - Phase 1: Core scanning & detection
   - Phase 2: Archive extraction (planned)
   - Phase 3: Installation management (planned)
   - Phase 4: Metadata fetching & save sync (planned)

5. **@mygamesanywhere/config** ‚úÖ
   - Centralized configuration for all integrations
   - Single `~/.mygamesanywhere/config.json` file
   - Environment variable overrides
   - Type-safe with Zod validation

6. **@mygamesanywhere/native-launcher** (planned)
   - Platform detection (Windows, macOS, Linux)
   - Launch executables
   - Monitor running processes
   - Track playtime
   - Unit tests

- ‚ùå Just functional test interface

### End-to-End Integration Flow

Test complete plugin system:

1. **Authorize Cloud Storage**
   - User authorizes Google Drive access
   - App creates `.mygamesanywhere/` folder
   - Initial empty library.json created

2. **Configure Steam Plugin**
   - User enters Steam installation path
   - User enters Steam Web API key (stored encrypted in OS keychain)
   - Plugin scans installed games
   - Games stored in local SQLite cache
   - Library synced to cloud (library.json)

3. **Configure Google Drive Plugin**
   - User completes OAuth flow
   - OAuth tokens stored encrypted on client
   - Plugin scans Drive folder for games
   - Games stored in local cache
   - Library synced to cloud

4. **Fetch Metadata**
   - User searches for game in IGDB plugin
   - Plugin fetches metadata and media URLs
   - Metadata cached locally (SQLite)
   - Client downloads cover images
   - Optionally cache metadata in cloud preferences

5. **Launch Game**
   - User clicks "Play" on Steam game
   - Native Launcher plugin launches via Steam
   - Client tracks playtime (SQLite)
   - When game exits, playtime synced to cloud (playtime.json)

6. **Multi-Device Sync** (Test on second device)
   - Install app on phone/laptop
   - Authorize same Google Drive account
   - App downloads library.json from cloud
   - Games appear automatically!

### Success Criteria
