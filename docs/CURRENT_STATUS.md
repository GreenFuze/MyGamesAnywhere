## In Progress ðŸš§

### @mygamesanywhere/igdb-client (Placeholder)
- [ ] Twitch OAuth (required for IGDB)
- [ ] Game search by title
- [ ] Fetch detailed metadata
- [ ] Rate limiting (4 req/sec)
- [ ] Unit tests

### Game Identifier Module (Next Up)
- [ ] Match detected games to metadata
- [ ] Use storefront APIs for storefront games (Steam)
- [ ] Use IGDB for non-storefront games
- [ ] Fuzzy matching based on filename/folder name
- [ ] Confidence scoring for matches
- [ ] Test with 202 detected games from Google Drive

---

## Test Results

### Google Drive Game Scanning (Real Test)
**Folder:** MyGamesAnywhere test collection
**Duration:** 269 seconds (~4.5 minutes)
**Results:**
- Files scanned: 763
- Directories scanned: 121
- Games found: **202**

**Breakdown by Type:**
- ROM: 148 games (73%)
- Installer Executable: 28 games (14%)
- Archived: 25 games (12%)
- Portable Game: 1 game (0.5%)

**Conclusion:** Scanner successfully detects multiple game formats across recursive directory structure.

### Steam Scanner (Real Test)
**Test User:** GreenFuze (via Steam username)
**Results:**
- Successfully fetched owned games from Steam Web API
- Local detection from Steam installation
- 88 unit tests passing

---

## Architecture Decisions Made

### Serverless Architecture âœ…
- **NO SERVER!** All functionality runs on client
- Cloud storage sync via user's Google Drive/OneDrive
- User owns all data (local device + their cloud storage)
- Zero hosting costs

### Plugin System (Future Phase 2)
- Client-side TypeScript modules
- Privacy-first: user data stays local
- Encrypted config storage (OS keychain)
- Plugin capabilities: Source, Platform, Metadata, Feature, UI

### OAuth Security Model âœ…
- OAuth client credentials embedded in app (public for native apps)
- Credentials identify the APP, not the user
- Each user gets personal token via browser login
- Standard approach: GitHub CLI, Google Cloud SDK, VS Code
- Users can revoke access anytime

---

## Technology Stack

### Core (Phase 1)
- **TypeScript** 5.x
- **Node.js** 18+
- **Vitest** - Testing framework
- **Zod** - Runtime validation
- **ESLint + Prettier** - Code quality

### Integration-Specific
- Custom VDF parser (Steam)
- Google OAuth 2.0 libraries
- Axios (HTTP client)
- UUID (unique IDs)
- Open (browser launcher)

### Future Phases
- **Frontend:** Ionic + Capacitor + React
- **State Management:** Zustand
- **Local Cache:** SQLite with FTS
- **Monorepo:** Nx (for full app)

---

## Next Immediate Steps

### 1. Game Identifier Module (Next)
**Goal:** Match detected games to metadata

**Approach:**
1. **For Steam games:** Use Steam API for metadata (already have)
2. **For other games:**
   - Extract game name from filename/folder
   - Search IGDB API
   - Fuzzy match with confidence scoring
   - Return metadata (title, cover, description, etc.)

**Test with:** 202 detected games from Google Drive scan

### 2. IGDB Client Integration
- Implement Twitch OAuth
- Game search and metadata fetch
- Rate limiting
- Cache responses

### 3. Native Launcher (Future)
- Platform detection
- Process spawning and monitoring
- Playtime tracking

## Success Metrics (Phase 1)

**Completed:**
- [x] Steam scanner finds games on real Steam installation (âœ… 88 tests passing)
- [x] Google Drive OAuth flow works end-to-end (âœ… Browser-based, auto-token)
- [x] Google Drive client has 41 passing tests
- [x] Generic repository detects all 6+ game types (âœ… 202 games detected)
- [x] Multi-part archive detection works (âœ… .part1, .z01, .001, .r00)
- [x] Cross-platform file classification (âœ… Windows/Linux/macOS)
- [x] Each package has README with examples

**In Progress:**

  - **Cause:** API rate limits (each file = separate API call)
  - **Solution:** Batch API calls, cache file metadata locally

### UX Improvements
- [ ] Progress indicators for long scans
- [ ] Cancel/pause long-running scans
- [ ] Better error messages for OAuth failures

### Documentation
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide for OAuth issues
- [ ] Document rate limits for each API
- [ ] Add examples for each package
