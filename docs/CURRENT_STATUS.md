## Test Results

### Plugin System Demo
**Tested:** Steam source + LaunchBox identifier
**Results:**
- Successfully initialized 2 plugins
- Scanned Steam library (local games)
- Automatic game merging (same game from multiple sources)
- Game identification with LaunchBox
- Multi-source detection working correctly

### LaunchBox Identifier Accuracy (11 test files)
**Accuracy:** 55% (6/11 correctly identified)

**Successfully Identified:**
- "Alone in the Dark 3" ‚Üí 90% confidence ‚úÖ
- "LEGO Batman: The Videogame" ‚Üí 67% confidence ‚úÖ
- "Pikuniku" ‚Üí 90% confidence ‚úÖ
- "Sonic Mega Collection Plus" ‚Üí 90% confidence ‚úÖ
- "God of War" ‚Üí 90% confidence ‚úÖ
- "HangMan.exe" ‚Üí 59% (false positive: matched "Cognition Episode 1") ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Failed to Identify:**
- "AD&D - Eye of the Beholder" (not in LaunchBox DB)
- "Devil May Cry - HD Collection" (not in LaunchBox DB)
- "Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart" (not in LaunchBox DB - too new)
- "GO.BAT" (too generic, needs directory context)
- Multi-part .bin file (needs Phase 2 grouping)

**Improvements Implemented:**
- ‚úÖ GOG pattern removal (version numbers, IDs, language codes)
- ‚úÖ Platform detection fix (.exe ‚Üí Windows, not DOS)
- ‚úÖ Improved version pattern matching (v1.922.0.0)
- ‚úÖ Trailing number removal (Dark 3 1 0 ‚Üí Dark 3)
- ‚úÖ Debug logging for extraction process

### Google Drive Scanner
**Duration:** 269 seconds (~4.5 minutes)
**Results:**
- Files scanned: 763
- Directories scanned: 121
- Games detected: **202**

**Breakdown by Type:**
- ROM: 148 games (73%)
- Installer Executable: 28 games (14%)
- Archived: 25 games (12%)
- Portable Game: 1 game (0.5%)

### Steam Scanner
**Test User:** GreenFuze
**Results:**
- ‚úÖ Local library scanning
- ‚úÖ Steam Web API integration
- ‚úÖ Username-based authentication
- ‚úÖ 88 unit tests passing

---

## Architecture Decisions Made

### Serverless Architecture ‚úÖ
- **NO SERVER!** All functionality runs on client
- Cloud storage sync via user's Google Drive/OneDrive
- User owns all data (local device + their cloud storage)
- Zero hosting costs

### Plugin System ‚úÖ (NEW!)
- **Multi-Source Support**: Same game across Steam, Xbox, local = 1 unified entry
- **Multi-Identifier Support**: Multiple metadata sources per game
- **Game Matching**: Fuzzy title matching, external ID matching, manual overrides
- **Type-Safe**: Full TypeScript with strict typing
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new sources/identifiers

**Example Multi-Source Game:**
```typescript
{
  id: "unified-123",
  title: "God of War",
  sources: [
    { sourceId: "steam-source", gameId: "steam-local-582010" },
    { sourceId: "epic-source", gameId: "epic-godofwar" },
    { sourceId: "custom-storefront", gameId: "custom-godofwar.zip" }
  ],
  identifications: [
    { identifierId: "launchbox", confidence: 0.90 },
    { identifierId: "igdb", confidence: 0.95 }
  ],
  isInstalled: true,  // Installed in Steam
  totalPlaytime: 4200 // Sum from all sources
}
```

### OAuth Security Model ‚úÖ
- OAuth client credentials embedded in app (public for native apps)
- Credentials identify the APP, not the user
- Each user gets personal token via browser login
- Standard approach: GitHub CLI, Google Cloud SDK, VS Code
- Users can revoke access anytime

---

## Technology Stack

### Core
- **TypeScript** 5.x
- **Node.js** 18+
- **Vitest** - Testing framework
- **Zod** - Runtime validation
- **ESLint + Prettier** - Code quality

### Integration-Specific
- Custom VDF parser (Steam)
- Google OAuth 2.0 libraries
- SQLite with FTS5 (LaunchBox database)
- Fuse.js (fuzzy matching)
- xml-stream (LaunchBox XML parsing)
- Levenshtein distance (string similarity)

### Phase 3 (Desktop UI) - Starting Now
- **Electron** - Desktop application framework
- **React** - UI framework
- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling (gamers theme)
- **Zustand** - State management
- **Framer Motion** - Animations
- **React Router** - Navigation
